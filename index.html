                                    Hello, I am Supriti Vijay, an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science Engineering at the Manipal Institute Of Technology, India. My research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing. My past work involves Social Network Science, Interpretability and Text Classification. I'm currently a research intern at Adobe India Research. 
                                    I am honoured to be amongst the six girls all over India who were awarded the <a href="https://research.adobe.com/adobe-india-women-in-technology-scholarship/india-scholarship-winners/"> Adobe India Women-In-Tech Scholarship </a>.

                              During my pre-final year, I was the General Secretary of the <a href="http://www.researchsocietymit.com/"> Research Society MIT </a>, an organization dedicated to guiding undergraduate students from a multitude of different fields in research, to foster and make the research culture more habitable for students. We’re always looking for potential collaborations and would be grateful for external assistance, so if you would like to assist the organization in any way, you can reach out to them at their <a href="mailto:research.society.mit@gmail.com"> email</a>. A list of publications and projects underway is available at their <a href="http://www.researchsocietymit.com/"> website </a> for your reference.

                               I come from Jaipur, Rajasthan but spent most of my childhood in a small town in Java, Indonesia. This made me experience two different worlds and learn languages. Outside research, I enjoy playing badminton, swimming and like exploring and travelling to new places.

                My goal is to use natural language processing for social good, particularly to eradicate the implicit bias present and make the society more equitable and inclusive. I am also interested in working with low resource languages and making them more accessible and interpretable to users from all around the world, breaking communication barriers in place.
                <br>Currently, my research focuses on bias in NLP, model interpretability, and low resource languages.

                      &nbsp;&nbsp; With increasing applications in areas such as biomedical information extraction pipelines and social media analytics, Named Entity Recognition (NER) has become an indispensable tool for knowledge extraction. However, with the gradual shift in language structure and vocabulary, NERs are plagued with distribution shifts, making them redundant or not as profitable without re-training. Re-training NERs based on Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch over newly acquired data poses economic disadvantages. In contrast, re-training only with newly acquired data will result in Catastrophic Forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Therefore, we propose NERDA-Con, a pipeline for training NERs with LLM bases by incorporating the concept of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) into the NER fine-tuning NERDA pipeline \cite{nerda}. As we believe our work has implications to be utilized in the pipeline of continual learning and NER, we open-source our code as well as provide the fine-tuning library of the same name NERDA-Con at https://github.com/SupritiVijay/NERDA-Con and https://pypi.org/project/NERDA-Con/.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp; The increasing use of social media sites in countries like India has given rise to large volumes of code-mixed data. Sentiment analysis of this data can provide integral insights into people{'}s perspectives and opinions. Code-mixed data is often noisy in nature due to multiple spellings for the same word, lack of definite order of words in a sentence, and random abbreviations. Thus, working with code-mixed data is more challenging than monolingual data. Interpreting a model{'}s predictions allows us to determine the robustness of the model against different forms of noise. In this paper, we propose a methodology to integrate explainable approaches into code-mixed sentiment analysis. By interpreting the predictions of sentiment analysis models we evaluate how well the model is able to adapt to the implicit noises present in code-mixed data.                        </div>

    abstract = "The increasing use of social media sites in countries like India has given rise to large volumes of code-mixed data. Sentiment analysis of this data can provide integral insights into people{'}s perspectives and opinions. Code-mixed data is often noisy in nature due to multiple spellings for the same word, lack of definite order of words in a sentence, and random abbreviations. Thus, working with code-mixed data is more challenging than monolingual data. Interpreting a model{'}s predictions allows us to determine the robustness of the model against different forms of noise. In this paper, we propose a methodology to integrate explainable approaches into code-mixed sentiment analysis. By interpreting the predictions of sentiment analysis models we evaluate how well the model is able to adapt to the implicit noises present in code-mixed data.",<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp; Explanations for AI systems have been used to improve the trustworthiness of these systems.These explanations can be used to find the undesirable implicit biases that machine learning models can rely on for their outputs. We apply this concept to detect gender bias in sentiment analysis models for textual data. With the help of an Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), we use different gender signals for otherwise identical input to the system and use explanations from LIME and SHAP to find a trend of bias, and identify terms that contribute the most to it.
